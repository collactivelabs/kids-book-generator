# Frontend Development Plan for Kids Book Generator

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the React frontend of the Kids Book Generator application. The frontend will provide users with an intuitive interface to configure, generate, and manage children's books.

## Architecture

The frontend will follow a modern React architecture:

- **React 18+** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit** or **React Context API** for state management
- **Axios** for API communication
- **React Query** for data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Styled Components** or **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Project Structure

The frontend will be organized as follows:

```

```

## Key Components

Following our code organization rules (max 300 lines per file), we'll split functionality into these components:

### Authentication
- `LoginForm.tsx`: User login form
- `RegisterForm.tsx`: User registration form
- `AuthContext.tsx`: Authentication context provider
- `ProtectedRoute.tsx`: Route guard for authenticated routes

### Book Configuration
- `BookConfigForm.tsx`: Main book configuration form
- `BookTypeSelector.tsx`: Book type selection component
- `MetadataForm.tsx`: Book metadata entry form
- `TemplateSelector.tsx`: Template selection component
- `ThemeSelector.tsx`: Theme selection component

### Book Generation
- `GenerationWorkflow.tsx`: Generation workflow controller
- `ProgressTracker.tsx`: Progress tracking component
- `PreviewPane.tsx`: Book preview component
- `GenerationOptions.tsx`: Advanced generation options

### Book Management
- `BooksList.tsx`: List of user's books
- `BookDetails.tsx`: Detailed view of a book
- `BatchJobsList.tsx`: List of batch jobs
- `BatchJobDetails.tsx`: Detailed view of a batch job

## API Integration

The frontend will communicate with the backend API using the following services:

- `authService.ts`: Authentication API calls
- `booksService.ts`: Book-related API calls
- `canvaService.ts`: Canva integration API calls
- `batchService.ts`: Batch processing API calls

## State Management

We'll implement:

- Authentication state: User details, permissions, and tokens
- Book state: Current book configuration, generation progress
- UI state: Loading states, error messages, modals

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Authentication (Week 1)
- Initialize React application with TypeScript
- Set up routing with React Router
- Implement authentication flows
- Create protected routes

### Phase 2: Book Configuration UI (Week 2)
- Create book metadata entry forms
- Implement template selection
- Add theme and style configuration
- Build book type selection

### Phase 3: Generation Workflow (Week 3)
- Implement generation process UI
- Create preview functionality
- Add progress tracking
- Build batch processing interface

### Phase 4: Book Management (Week 4)
- Create books listing and filtering
- Implement book details view
- Add batch job management
- Create analytics dashboard

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Week 5)
- Implement unit tests
- Add integration tests
- Optimize performance
- Improve accessibility

## Design Principles

- Follow a consistent design language
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement progressive loading for large assets
- Focus on accessibility
- Use proper error handling
- Implement comprehensive form validation

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment

The frontend will be deployed using:
- Build optimization with Vite
- Static hosting on cloud provider
- CI/CD integration for automated deployment

## Next Steps

1. Setup React project with TypeScript
2. Implement basic routing and layout
3. Create authentication components
4. Build book configuration UI
