# Phase 5: User Interface Development - Backend Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the backend components for Phase 5 of the Kids Book Generator project. This document outlines the backend features implemented and the remaining frontend work to complete this phase.

## Backend Components Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- Comprehensive JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control with scopes (users:read, users:write, books:read, books:write, admin)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token management with expiration and refresh capabilities
- Integration with Canva OAuth for external authentication

### 2. User Management API
- User registration and profile management
- User authentication endpoints
- Profile updating and retrieval
- Admin user management features

### 3. Book Management API
- Complete CRUD operations for books
- Book generation and status tracking
- Book preview and download functionality
- Book publishing workflow

### 4. Batch Processing System
- Batch job creation and management
- Parallel processing of multiple books
- Job status tracking
- Background tasks for non-blocking operations

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are now available:

- `/api/v1/users/*` - User management endpoints
- `/api/v1/books/*` - Book management endpoints
- `/api/v1/batch/*` - Batch processing endpoints
- `/api/v1/canva/*` - Canva integration endpoints

## Next Steps: Frontend Implementation

To complete Phase 5, we need to implement the React frontend:

1. **Setup React Application**
   - Create React application with TypeScript
   - Set up routing and state management
   - Configure API integration

2. **Authentication UI**
   - Implement login and registration forms
   - Add OAuth integration for Canva
   - Create protected routes for authenticated users

3. **Book Creation and Management UI**
   - Design book configuration interface
   - Implement book editor with Canva integration
   - Create book list and detail views

4. **Batch Processing UI**
   - Design batch job creation interface
   - Implement batch job monitoring dashboard
   - Create job progress visualization

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Implement user management interface
   - Create system monitoring dashboard
   - Add usage statistics visualization

## Current Status

We've successfully completed the backend portion of Phase 5, which includes:
- ✅ FastAPI backend implementation
- ✅ API endpoint creation
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ User management
- ✅ Batch processing

The remaining frontend tasks will be tackled next:
- ❌ React frontend setup
- ❌ Book configuration UI
- ❌ Generation workflow
- ❌ Progress tracking

## Technical Details

The backend implementation follows these principles:
- RESTful API design
- JWT authentication with scopes
- Background task processing for long-running operations
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive API documentation through FastAPI

## Dependencies

- FastAPI - Web framework
- Pydantic - Data validation
- PyJWT - JWT token handling
- Passlib - Password hashing
- aiohttp - Async HTTP client for external API calls
