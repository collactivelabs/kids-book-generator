# Phase 4: Canva Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 4 of the Kids Book Generator project: Canva Integration. The Canva Connect API integration provides a powerful way to create, modify, and export professionally designed book templates for both storybooks and coloring books.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Canva Connect API Client (`src/integrations/canva.py`)

A comprehensive client for interacting with the Canva Connect API, including:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with authorization URLs and token exchange
- Design creation, retrieval, and management
- Asset upload and management (images, graphics)
- Brand integration for consistent design systems
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Design export to various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG)

### 2. Template Management System (`src/integrations/canva_templates.py`)

A system for managing book design templates, including:

- Template creation, storage, and retrieval
- Template matching based on book type, trim size, and age group
- Default templates for different book formats
- Template properties for consistent design application
- Template import from Canva designs

### 3. Design Export System (`src/integrations/canva_export.py`)

A system for exporting designs from Canva to our application, including:

- Asynchronous PDF export with status tracking
- Image extraction from PDFs
- Conversion to KDP-compatible formats
- Background task processing for non-blocking exports

### 4. Preview System (`src/integrations/canva_preview.py`)

A real-time preview generation system, including:

- Thumbnail generation from Canva designs
- Interactive preview of PDFs
- Image resizing and format conversion
- Grid overlay for design reference
- Base64 encoding for web display

### 5. API Endpoints (`src/api/routers/canva.py`)

A comprehensive set of API endpoints for the frontend to interact with Canva functionality:

- Authentication endpoints
- Template management endpoints
- Design management endpoints
- Export endpoints
- Preview endpoints
- Asset management endpoints

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The Canva integration has been seamlessly integrated with the existing codebase:

- Routes were added to the main application (`src/main.py`)
- Router was added to the API routes (`src/api/routes.py`)
- Dependencies were added to requirements.txt
- Tests were created to ensure functionality

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the Canva integration in future phases:

1. **Caching for Previews**: Implement caching for design previews to improve performance
2. **Batch Processing**: Add support for batch design exports
3. **Template Versioning**: Implement versioning for templates
4. **Design Collaboration**: Add support for collaborative design editing
5. **Analytics**: Track template usage and popularity

## Testing

Tests for the Canva integration have been implemented in `tests/integrations/test_canva_integration.py` and cover:

- Canva Connect API client functionality
- Template management
- Design export
- Preview generation

## Dependencies

The following dependencies were added to support the Canva integration:

- `aiohttp`: For asynchronous HTTP requests
- `PyMuPDF`: For PDF manipulation and extraction
